# CatFeedingRegulator
I have 2 cats. Saki eats too much cat food and barfs (a lot). This is an overly technical solution to make sure she doesn't explode.

Hardware:
-------------------------
Raspberry Pi connected to 2 Adafruit Metro Mini's. Raspberry pi will be running python script with vision model. Metro Minis run weight sensor and control servos to cover food.
